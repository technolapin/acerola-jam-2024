* Concept

The theme of the jam being "aberration", it sounds like a good idea to take something natural and to make it behave unnaturaly.
I will make a game where you make a plant grow unnaturaly. The plant will dig the ground to extract nutrients and water and grow leaves to produce energy that will be used to grow more, that's the "plant" part. The abberant behavior will be that the plant will also incorporate non-plant-ish nutrients such as ores and so, and will incorporate them to produce some unnatural traits.
For instance, the plant will be able to eat iron ore to become sturdier, allowing to grow higher and to dig in solid rock.
